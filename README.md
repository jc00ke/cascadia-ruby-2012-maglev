# Would you like to forget about the database?

My talk at [Cascadia Ruby 2012](http://cascadiaruby.com) on the power we get from [MagLev](http://maglev.github.com)'s transparent object persistence (aka baked-in object database).

Just crack open `index.html` in a browser to view the slides. If you want to see them with speaker notes, ROFLSCALE your system & install `node`. You can find more instructions on reveal.js [here](http://hakim.se/projects/reveal-js).

You can run locally with `rackup`.
